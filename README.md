# Welcome to the Rygen Java & Vue Work Sample

At Rygen, we care deeply about who joins our team, so congrats on making it to this round in the process!

One of our goals, as we continue the conversation, is to learn more about how you think about and solve technical problems so that we can get a sense of what it will be like working together day-to-day. That's what we're going to focus on here.

**First things first:** This assessment is not intended to take a large portion of your time. We're looking for _quality_ of engineering, not _quantity_ of engineering. The code sample and tasks are open-ended and designed so you can choose what parts of the sample you want to work on.

And, of course, feel free to use any resources you would in your normal day-to-day work experience. You will be expected to be capable of explaining any AI generated code.

## Setting Up Your Environment

> This sample requires a host with Node.js and Java 17 installed.

Run a gradle build and npm install before proceeding to ensure your system or IDE is set up correctly.

- Check that you can run the backend:

 ```shell
  ./gradlew build -x test
 ```

- Check that you can run the frontend:

 ```shell
  cd light-controller-ui
  npm install
  npm run build
 ```

Open the [intersection-light-controller.feature](./src/main/features/intersection-light-controller.feature) Gherkin Spec file where the work sample instructions begin.

## Reach out if you are stuck

If the instructions in this sample don't work for any reason, or you get hopelessly stuck while coding, don't stress! Send us an email, and we'll help you get unblocked!

## Commit early, commit often

Git is the core of how we manage code. We would like to see how you organize your code and package it for others to see. _In case of fire `git commit && git push`._

## Submitting your work

To submit your work sample, push your code to a public repository and share the repo link with us. Please include your responses to the following questions.

1. How would you evaluate your work? What went well? What would you do differently?
1. What was an insight you gained or something you learned while working on this?
1. If you were to add another test challenge to this, what would it be? Why?

**Good luck and happy coding!**
